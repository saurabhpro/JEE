Your query must filter for scores greater than or equal to 65, which is in the matching portion of the query, and you want to go from low to high, so that's going to be a standard sort on score. Therefore, your query is:

db.grades.find( { score : { $gte : 65 } } ).sort( { score : 1 } )

When you look at the scores, you can see that your lowest is for student_id : 22, which is the answer.
